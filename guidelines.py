The usage of the triple quotation marks (\""" \""") -also known as DOCSTRING- is for the 
purpose of making this file as interactive as possible, giving the reader the power to choose which
part of the code to be executed, without over encumbering the terminal. The docstring usage will be
given more detail once the special string literal category is reached far below.

To use the striple quotation marks (\""" \""") properly these steps should be followed:
1- Identify the given example you want to run inside this file 
2- Add three " over the first comment below the example that says "# ~ Example finish"
3- Add three " below the first comment over the example that says "# ~ Example start"
4- Run the file and manipulate it as you see fit
5- Remove the " you added by the step 2 and step 3 of this guide
6- Go back to step 1

The usage of the special character "#" -also known as COMMENT- is to tell interpreter to ignore the
rest of the line when the
program is run. It is used to provide information or explanations about the code for the readers.
The usage of the extension "better comments" is advised, as it improves readability.

The examples demand input of the reader and offers output for each example in order to give more
interaction to the user with the learning process. The file asks for input by the implement of the
function "input()" and offers output by the implementation of the function "print()", which will be
covered in detail once the usage of functions has been reached.

The steps to get the most out of this file is:
1- Read the documentation about the desired subject, e.g: Variables.
2- Choose the desired example to be tested, e.g: String data type.
3- Experiment with the code, making changes and learning it's behavior by running the script
4- Implement the knowledge into your own personal projects to solidify the learning process
5- Advance logically to the next subject, e.g: Boolean data type.
