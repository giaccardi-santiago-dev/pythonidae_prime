Course guidelines

PURPOSE
Practical understanding of the Python language, thorought empirical acquariment of knowledge

MMETHODOLOGY
Usage of: code writing, code reading, code execution, code testing, code documentation

BASIC CONCEPTS
This course is based of three basics concepts of a functioning computer. INPUT, PROCESS and OUTPUT.
Starting with INPUT, you will be exposed to different kinds of inputs thorought different
situations, while keeping you in charge of said input so you get practical experience.
PROCESS, you will be explained what does the code do with the input you gave to the program so that 
a basic understanding of the behind the scenes is secured.
OUTPUT, the final result will always be shown to give logic closure to the subject and give you a
chance to verify the process state.

Tutorial section

The usage of the triple quotation marks -also known as DOCSTRING- is for the 
purpose of making this file as interactive as possible, giving the reader the power to choose which
part of the code to be executed, without over encumbering the terminal. The docstring usage will be
given more detail once the special string literal category is reached. The DOCSTRING can be turned
on and off by adding a simple backlslash behind the triple quotation mark.

To use the striple quotation marks (\""" \""") properly these steps should be followed:
1- Identify the given example you want to run inside the desired file 
2- Delete the backslash behind the initial and ending triple quotation marks
4- Run the file and manipulate it as you see fit
5- Remove the " you added by the step 2 and step 3 of this guide
6- Go back to step 1

The usage of the special character "#" -also known as COMMENT- is to tell interpreter to ignore the
rest of the line when the
program is run. It is used to provide information or explanations about the code for the readers.
The usage of the extension "better comments" is advised, as it improves readability.

The examples demand input of the reader and offers output for each example in order to give more
interaction to the user with the learning process. The file asks for input by the implement of the
function "input()" and offers output by the implementation of the function "print()", which will be
covered in detail once the usage of functions has been reached.

The steps to get the most out of this file is:
1- Read the documentation about the desired subject, e.g: Variables.
2- Choose the desired example to be tested, e.g: String data type.
3- Experiment with the code, making changes and learning it's behavior by running the script
4- Implement the knowledge into your own personal projects to solidify the learning process
5- Advance logically to the next subject, e.g: Boolean data type.
